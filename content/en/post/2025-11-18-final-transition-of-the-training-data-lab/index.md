In August 2025, we announced the transition of Training Data Lab to a **living archive mode**, with the aim of preserving the work developed since 2020 without creating expectations of regular activity that we could no longer sustain responsibly. Since then, we have been relocating our initiatives and collaborations to spaces with more stable structures and institutional support.

Starting in 2026, most of the activities we previously promoted under the Training Data Lab, including applied projects, data analysis, and tool development, have been carried out as consultancies and professional projects through [Empiria Lab](https://empirialab.cl/). Several of the researchers who were part of our group continue to collaborate there, now in a format focused on knowledge transfer, solving specific problems for public and private institutions, and designing solutions based on data and artificial intelligence.

In this new scenario, the series [Tufte Working Papers (ISSN 2735-6043)]({{< relref "../tufte-working-papers" >}}) will no longer accept manuscripts, and new issues will not be published. Documents already published will remain available in open access as part of our legacy, but the series will now be exclusively historical in nature, with no editorial processes or incorporation of new works.

For those interested in methodological and technical contributions similar to those featured in Training Data Lab, we recommend the **Empiria Lab Method Series (ISSN 3087-2553)**, available at [https://empirialab.cl/repositorio](https://empirialab.cl/repositorio). This series transparently documents design decisions, workflows, implementation strategies, and results of applied projects, maintaining an emphasis on technical clarity and reproducibility, but framed within a professional and sustainable structure.

With this announcement, we close the active cycle of Training Data Lab as an operational research group, maintaining its site as a living archive and guiding our community towards the spaces where new initiatives continue and are planned today. We would like to thank once again all those who participated, collaborated or disseminated our projects, and we invite you to stay in touch through the activities and publications of [Empiria Lab](https://empirialab.cl/).
