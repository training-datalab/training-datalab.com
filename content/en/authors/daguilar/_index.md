I am a policy researcher at Indigenous Services Canada (ISC), part of the Canadian Federal Government. I work on a team that ensures the successful implementation of sustainable infrastructure projects, such as energy systems, structural mitigation, and winter roads, in Indigenous communities across Canada. I am also a member of the [Brantford Public Library Board](https://www.brantfordlibrary.ca/en/about-the-library/library-board.aspx), where I help shape policies, manage financial oversight, and lead as chair of the Governance Committee.

Before moving to Canada, I worked as a lawyer at the National Consumer Service (*Servicio Nacional del Consumidor*, SERNAC) in Chile, where I was part of the collective mediation team and also served as international relations coordinator.

I hold an MA in Political Science from the [Universidad de Chile](https://gobierno.uchile.cl/), an MA in Global Politics from [McMaster University, Canada](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/), and an LLB from the Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Chile. My interests include transparency and open government, public policy, Indigenous affairs, and international relations.
