I am an assistant professor in the [School of Government and Public Administration at Universidad Mayor in Santiago, Chile](https://www.umayor.cl/um/carreras/administracion-publica-santiago). I received my [PhD in Political Science from the University of California, Irvine](https://www.polisci.uci.edu/) and I hold an MA in Political Science from UC Irvine and an MA in Communication from [Universidad Diego Portales, Chile](https://www.udp.cl/). I also have a BA Political Science from [Universidad Alberto Hurtado](https://www.uahurtado.cl/), Chile.

I study comparative political behavior in Latin America, with a special focus on Chile. My research interests include public opinion, election campaigns, media consumption, and political participation. My current research agenda focuses on the personalization of politics in a comparative perspective, with a special focus on Latin America. I am interested in understanding why candidates personalize their election campaigns, why people look at candidates’ characteristics when making voting decisions, and how election campaigns shape political attitudes and behaviors. I am also interested in understanding people’s political involvement, both online and offline.
